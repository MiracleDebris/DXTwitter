**DXTwitter**, an imitation sample client of Twitter. 

About
-
There are some interesting UI animations in Twitter iOS client, so I have been thinking about to imitate it since I started to learn the development of iOS app. Now this project is finally started! And all the features are completed by the simplest way that I can think of.

How to use
-
I will tidy and split the above features into several individual components next and then release them by CocoaPods. Coming soon.(So you could just copy it to your project for now 2333)

Issuses and plans
-
There are tons of issuses in this project for the time being. And I will try my best to make it better just like the Twitter it self!
